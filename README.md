## Simple Chat

This is my second React app, this time the goal was to learn how to use Hooks and Functional components instead of Class Components.

## Goal

To create a chat application with living previous state. The inital version will only have current state since it is using sockets, however the goal is to save information to a DB and broadcast it when a new user connects.
